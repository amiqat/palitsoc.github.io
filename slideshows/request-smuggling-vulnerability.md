      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Http requests are sent over network in binary data format.</li>
        <li>the server needs to interpret that network traffic and convert it to multiple requests.</li>
        <li>Since there are always will be subsequent requests to the target server, It needs to use a mechanism to determine the boundary of each request (i.e where the request begins, ends and the next request begins) and so on.</li>
        <li>Each request must have be supplied with (in the header) of what the mechanism is used to determine its boundary.</li>
      </ul>
</section>

<section>
      <h2>Specifying the Boundary</h2>
      <p>There are two approaches to determine the boundary of each single request:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <b>Content Length Header:</b> it specifies the length of the message body in bytes
