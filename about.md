# What are we About?
The Palestinian IT Society is a grassroots group whose goal is to create a space for sharing in the professional IT industry in Palestine. We seek to help professionals and students network, connect, share knowledge, and grow together.

## Our 3 Principles

- Openness : We are open for anyone to participate in anything we do and speak their mind.
- Community : We want to build a community - we care for each other and for our industry as a whole.
- Knowledge : We believe in the importance of knwoledge - we are in a knowledge-based industry after all. We urge any and all to share their knowledge, and to not hide what they know; as we believe that is truly the best way to grow.

## Our Activities

We are still very young - we want you to join and help us define our activities. We intend to host meet-ups, seminars, and other similar community events, where we can all sit on equal grounds and share.

## Our Goals

Our goal is to grow the Palestinian IT Industry by breaking down barriers between its workers - by sharing knwoledge, and creating open, level ground for discussion, we believe we can help the industry shape up and compete on an ever higher level globally
